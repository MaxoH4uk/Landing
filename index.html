        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and
          other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of
          knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our
          privacy and freedom.

        <p>
          But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple: An
          autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered
          by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and
          end-to-end encryption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Put even simpler —
          <strong>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</strong>
